My name is Karl Berggren, I am a data scientist, researcher, engineer, photographer and father based in Stockholm, Sweden.

This website serves as a web developement sandbox for me and will therefore always be under construction to some extent. It is also the home of my current blog, where I plan to log different personal projects.
