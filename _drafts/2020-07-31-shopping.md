(List of shops by region)[https://www.alexotos.com/keyboard-vendor-list/]

I bought my things from

- KBDfans (China)
  - KBD75v2 DIY kit
    - Top silver, bottom gray case
    - Aluminium switch plate
  - 90 Aliaz 70g switches (my layout requires 84)
  - Cherry screw-in stabilizers
  - Case foam (between case and PCB)
  - Module foam (between PBD and plate)
  - KBDfans DSA keycap set

Some comments: Screw-in stabilizers are supposed to be better than click-ins. Discovered module foam to fill out the airgap between the PCB and plate to further reduce noise (which I am all about).

- Pimp My Keyboard aka Signature Plastics (USA)
 - A few specific colored DSA caps to jazz up the otherwise grey set I got from KBDfans. I also want to judge their quality since I've read a lot of good things about them.

- MaxGaming (Sweden)
  - O-rings

- KeyGem (Germany)
  - Krytox 205g0 lube

- CandyKeys (Germany)
  - Craftcables USB cable
