The KBIC65 is a [65%](https://keyboard.university/100-courses/keyboard-sizes-layouts-gdeby) [mechanical keyboard](https://keyboard.university/100-courses/intro-to-mechanical-keyboards-p6brj) with a [through-hole technology design](https://www.google.com/search?q=through-hole+technology+keyboard&tbm=isch) design and a [ProMicro controller](https://deskthority.net/wiki/Arduino_Pro_Micro) footprint.

Some of the more unique features include:
- Low copper coverage on top of PCBs to improve Bluetooth signal for controllers such as the [nice!nano](https://nicekeyboards.com/nice-nano/)
- [Plate bottom mount](https://thomasbaart.nl/2019/04/07/cheat-sheet-custom-keyboard-mounting-styles/), main PCB is only connected to the top plate via the soldered switches. Opens up for variants on [isolation/gasket mount](https://thomasbaart.nl/2019/04/07/cheat-sheet-custom-keyboard-mounting-styles/)
- Top plate overhang on top and bottom to allow for plate or isolation mount case designs
- Backside PCB art of a dithered sun from [NASA SDO](https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/13641)

The keyboard is well covered on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/b-karl/KBIC65) and I have also written a [build log](/_posts\2021-08-29-kbic65-build-log.md).
