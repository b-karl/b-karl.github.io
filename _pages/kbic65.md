The KBIC65 is a [65%]() [mechanical keyboard]() with a [through-hole technology]() design and a [ProMicro controller]() footprint.

Some of the more unique features include:
- Low copper coverage on top of PCBs to improve Bluetooth signal for controllers such as the [nice!nano]()
- [Plate mount](), main PCB is only connected to the top plate via the soldered switches. Opens up for variants on [isolation mount]()
- Top plate overhang on top and bottom to allow for plate or isolation mount case designs
- Backside PCB art of a dithered sun from [NASA SDO]()

The keyboard is well covered on the [GitHub repo]() and I have also written a [build log]().
