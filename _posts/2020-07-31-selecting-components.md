It is now time to pick and order parts for my keyboard. Having talked to some friends, felt around some mechanical keyboards and using the T440 keyboard as a inspiration I decided I want to build a 75% compact layout with tactile switches and generally try to make it as quiet as possible. 

After recommendation from a colleague, I decided to go with the following components:
- [KBDFANS KBD75 keyboard](https://kbdfans.com/collections/diy-kit/products/kbd75v2-custom-keyboard-diy-kit)
  - Compact TKL layout: has F1-F12 and arrow keys
  - CNC milled aluminum case
  - Opted for an aluminum plate due to reading they have better acoustics for a silent keyboard
- [KBDFANS DSA Dye-sub PBT keycaps](https://kbdfans.com/collections/dsa-profile/products/kbdfans-dsa-dye-sub-keycaps)
  - Uniform keycaps so that it easy to move around keycaps, also low profile to reduce height of keyboard
- [Gateron/KBDFANS Aliaz 70g silent tactile switches](https://kbdfans.com/collections/aliaz-switches/products/pre-orderaliaz-silent-switch-tactile?variant=2519899799565)
  - 70g is supposed to be the approximate weight of Thinkpad switches
- [Case-to-PCB foam](https://kbdfans.com/products/kbd75-case-foam?_pos=3&_sid=ceffd2fa6&_ss=r) and [PCB-to-plate foam](https://kbdfans.com/products/kbdfans-module-foam?_pos=1&_sid=ceffd2fa6&_ss=r) to minimize reverb
- Some individually colored DSA keycaps to make it more fun from [Signature Plastics](https://pimpmykeyboard.com/) (also to compare quality since Signature Plastics are considered very high quality)
