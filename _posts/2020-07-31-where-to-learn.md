I won't go into the details about how and why mechanical keyboards and the community exists because there are already a ton of great articles and resources out there about it. Some that I have read and find interesting:

- [Drop.com: Anatomy Of A Mechanical Keyboard](https://drop.com/talk/10016/anatomy-of-a-mechanical-keyboard)
- [Matt3o.com: How To Build A Keyboard](https://matt3o.com/all-you-need-to-build-a-custom-keyboard/)
- [Smashing Magazine: A Complete Guide To Mechanical Keyboards](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2020/05/complete-guide-mechanical-keyboards/
)
- [The Verge: How And Why I Built My First Mechanical Keyboard](https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18683728/mechanical-keyboard-diy-building-guide-how-to-75-percent-pcb-case-zealio-keyswitches-zealpc)

Once you decide to delve deeper or want to buy or build something yourself the next step is often:
- [Reddit: Mechanical Keyboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/): General mechanical keyboard photos, a lot of pretty photos and help for people new and old in the hobby. They have a [pretty nice wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/wiki/index), even if it is a bit messy to navigate.
- [Reddit: OLKB](https://www.reddit.com/r/olkb/): Support forum for OLKB (vendor) but more importantly the main support place for QMK questions on Reddit.
- [GeekHack](https://geekhack.org/index.php): Old-school forum for mechanical keyboards and related things.
- Discord servers:
  - [KBDFANS](https://discord.gg/kbdfans) for everything related to KBDFANS plus guides and stuff
  - [mekaniskatangentbord.se](http://mekaniskatangentbord.se) is the most active Swedish mechanical keyboard community I have found
